Context engineering is the discipline of building the right information environment so an LLM can solve your actual problem. It was [named by Tobi Lutke](https://x.com/toaborern/status/1925629163972653200) and [Andrej Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1925942699000275282) in 2025, and it's quickly becoming the single most important skill in AI engineering.

**This is not another blog post or awesome-list.** This is a pattern catalog: 15 battle-tested patterns with runnable code, decision frameworks, and documented anti-patterns. Pick a problem, find the pattern, ship it.

## Why Context Engineering

Most LLM failures aren't model failures -- they're context failures. You gave the model the wrong information, too much information, or information in the wrong structure. Context engineering fixes this systematically.

Anthropic, Manus, LangChain, and others have published foundational articles on the topic. But until now, there was no single resource that combines a **comprehensive taxonomy** + **runnable code** + **decision frameworks** for practitioners who ship AI to production.

## Quick Start

**Find the right pattern for your problem:**

```
Your agent is forgetting things mid-conversation?
  --> Conversation Compaction (#7) or Episodic Memory (#11)

Your RAG pipeline returns relevant chunks but the LLM still hallucinates?
  --> RAG Context Assembly (#5) or Few-Shot Curation (#3)

Your system prompt is a wall of text and the model ignores half of it?
  --> System Prompt Architecture (#1) or Progressive Disclosure (#2)

Your agent calls the wrong tools?
  --> Semantic Tool Selection (#6) or Observation Masking (#8)

Your multi-agent system produces inconsistent results?
  --> Sub-Agent Delegation (#9) or Multi-Agent Context Orchestration (#10)

Your context window is filling up and responses are degrading?
  --> KV-Cache Optimization (#13) or Context Rot Detection (#15)

Your agent keeps repeating the same mistakes?
  --> Error Preservation (#14) or Filesystem-as-Memory (#12)
```

Or use the [Interactive Decision Tree](interactive/) for a guided walkthrough.

| 11 | [Episodic Memory](patterns/persistence/episodic-memory.md) | Store and retrieve task-specific memories across sessions | Medium |
| 12 | [Filesystem-as-Memory](patterns/persistence/filesystem-as-memory.md) | Use structured files as durable, inspectable agent memory | Low |

### Optimization -- Squeezing more performance from your context budget

| # | Pattern | Description | Complexity |
|---|---------|-------------|------------|
| 13 | [KV-Cache Optimization](patterns/optimization/kv-cache-optimization.md) | Structure prompts to maximize key-value cache hit rates | Medium |

### Evaluation -- Measuring context quality over time

| # | Pattern | Description | Complexity |
|---|---------|-------------|------------|

## Interactive Decision Tree

Not sure which pattern to use? The [Interactive Decision Tree](interactive/) walks you through a series of questions about your problem and recommends the best pattern.

```
What are you trying to solve?
  |
  |-- Agent isn't following instructions --> Construction patterns
  |-- Agent lacks the right knowledge   --> Retrieval patterns
  |-- Context window filling up         --> Compression patterns
  |-- Cross-contamination between tasks --> Isolation patterns
  |-- Agent forgets between sessions    --> Persistence patterns
  |-- Slow or expensive inference       --> Optimization patterns
  |-- Quality degrading over time       --> Evaluation patterns
```

## How Each Pattern is Structured

Every pattern follows a consistent template so you can evaluate and implement quickly:

```
patterns/<category>/<pattern-name>.md    # Full pattern documentation with inline code
```

Each pattern includes:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Problem** | The specific failure mode this pattern addresses |
| **Context** | When you'd encounter this problem |
| **Solution** | The pattern itself, with architecture diagram |
| **Implementation** | Step-by-step guide with code |
| **Decision Tree** | When to use this vs. alternatives |
| **Anti-Patterns** | Common mistakes when applying this pattern |
| **Metrics** | How to measure if it's working |
| **References** | Papers, blog posts, prior art |

## Anti-Patterns

Knowing what NOT to do is just as important. The [anti-patterns directory](anti-patterns/) documents common context engineering mistakes:

- **The Kitchen Sink** -- Dumping everything into the system prompt
- **Context Amnesia** -- Losing critical details during compaction
- **The Echo Chamber** -- Agent outputs become repetitive over long sessions
- **Stale Context Poisoning** -- Retrieved context is outdated but presented as current
- **Tool Schema Overload** -- Including all tool schemas regardless of relevance
- **The Infinite Loop** -- Retrying failures with no new information
- **Context Isolation Neglect** -- Running all work in a single context window

## Examples

Every pattern ships with runnable examples in both Python and TypeScript.

**Python:**

```bash
cd examples/python
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_example.py --pattern system-prompt-architecture
```

**TypeScript:**

```bash
cd examples/typescript
npm install
npx tsx run-example.ts --pattern system-prompt-architecture
```

Browse all examples in the [examples directory](examples/).
